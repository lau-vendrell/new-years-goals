# Goals 2026 ✨

This project started as a personal design and development experiment to explore:

- how goals feel when they all coexist at the same time  
- the balance between structure (table) and visual chaos (canvas)  
- how to build a simple interface with no backend and minimal friction  

It's designed for personal use: fast, calm, and account-free.

Each person only sees their own goals.
